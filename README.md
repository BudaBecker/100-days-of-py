# 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my personal repository tracking my progress through Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"!

This repository is a dedicated space where I'll be committing the code, projects, and notes I generate as I journey through this comprehensive Python course. The goal is to consistently code every day for 100 days, building a strong foundation in Python and developing a portfolio of diverse projects.

## About the Course

"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" is an intensive online course designed to take learners from complete beginners to proficient Python developers. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Python fundamentals (variables, data types, operators, control flow)
* Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
* Functions and modules
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Working with files and data
* Web development with frameworks like Flask and Django
* Data analysis and visualization
* Game development
* And much more!

The course emphasizes hands-on learning through daily coding exercises and engaging projects.

## Repository Structure

This repository will be organized as follows (subject to adjustments as the course progresses):

* **`day_XX` folders**: Each day of the challenge will have its own dedicated folder (e.g., `day_01`, `day_15`, `day_100`). These folders will contain:
    * Python code files (`.py`) for the daily exercises and projects.
    * Potentially, a `note.ipynb` file within the day's folder to provide a brief description of the day's learning and project.
    * Any associated files or resources for the daily projects.

## Why This Repository?

* **Accountability**: Publicly tracking my progress helps me stay committed to the 100-day challenge.
* **Learning and Review**: This repository serves as a personal archive for reviewing concepts and code I've learned.
* **Portfolio Building**: The projects developed during this bootcamp will contribute to my programming portfolio.
